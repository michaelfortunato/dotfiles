= What is this?

This folder is an attempt to track the packages I currently have on my primary
computer. I only have 1 computer these days so there is no need to have a
`Tacitus/_MANIFEST`. If in the future, you want that make sure you do
`Tacitus/_MANIFEST` and _not_ `_MANIFEST/Tacitus` as the computer sub-trees
(`Tacitus/`, `Melville/`) should mirror the repository and not the other way
around.
