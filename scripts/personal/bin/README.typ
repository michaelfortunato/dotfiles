== Warning <sec:Warning>

Do NOT put any sensitive code here as this folder is
linked to your dotfiles!


== Implementation Rules <subsec:Implementation-Rules>


All program filenames must start with `mnf`, for example,
a program which creates my daily note would be named `mnf-daily.sh` or
`mnf-daily.py` or just `mnf-daily`.

== XDG Spec verses This Folder <subsec:XDG-Spec-verses-This-Folder>

I spent about 45 minutes of my life debating between storing my personal
scripts in `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin`. I decided on `~/bin` because it will
be more likely I will check in on it as it is not hidden.
See this reddit discussion for a debate:
